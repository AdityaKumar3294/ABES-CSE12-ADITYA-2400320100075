        AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines or software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include things like:

Learning from data

Understanding language

Recognizing images and sounds

Making decisions

Solving problems

There are different types of AI:

Narrow AI: Designed to do one specific task (like virtual assistants or recommendation systems).

General AI: A theoretical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can (this doesn't exist yet).

In short, AI is about teaching computers to think and learn in ways similar to humans.
